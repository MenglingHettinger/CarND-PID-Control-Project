1. Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
	The P term is proportional to the current error. By only using this term, the controll will overshot.
	The I term is the integral term, which account for the accumulative error in the past. This term will correct the systematic bias.
	The D term is the differential term, which estimate the future error trend based on the current rate of change. The more rapid the change, the greater this term should be.


2. Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
	Set all gains to zero.
	Increase the P gain until the response to a disturbance is steady oscillation.
	Increase the D gain until the the oscillations go away (i.e. it's critically damped).
	Repeat the previous 2 steps until increasing the D gain does not stop the oscillations.
	Set P and D to the last stable values.
	Increase the I gain until it brings you to the setpoint with the number of oscillations desired (normally zero but a quicker response can be had if you don't mind a couple oscillations of overshoot)
